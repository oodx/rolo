# Rolo Project Continuation Guide

## Quick Start for Next Session

**TL;DR**: We built awesome flicker-free terminal chat demos but hit integration challenges with boxy tool. Start here:

```bash
cd /home/xnull/repos/code/rust/oodx/rolo/naive
./chat_demo.sh                    # Run the working baseline
CHAT_ORIENTATION=bottom ./chat_demo.sh  # Test bottom-up feed mode
```

## What We Built
1. **`demo.sh`** - Terminal layout techniques (static positioning, live updates, menus)
2. **`chat_demo.sh`** - Complete chat interface with dual orientation modes, slash commands, flicker-free updates
3. **`chat_boxy_demo.sh`** - Broken boxy integration attempt (garbled borders)

## The Challenge
- **boxy** creates complete, beautiful boxes but we need **dynamic real-time updates**
- Chat needs to update individual lines without redrawing entire interface
- How to combine boxy's professional styling with rolo's dynamic layout needs?

## Your Tools Available
- `boxy --help` - Professional box drawing with 90+ colors and themes
- `jynx --help` - Syntax highlighting with theme management

## Next Steps
1. Run working chat demo to see what works
2. Experiment with boxy integration strategies
3. Test jynx for code highlighting in messages
4. Solve the static vs dynamic rendering paradigm

## Files to Check
- **Working**: `chat_demo.sh` (baseline success)
- **Broken**: `chat_boxy_demo.sh` (integration attempt)
- **Reference**: `demo.sh` (layout techniques)
- **Session notes**: `.session/SESSION_01_*.md` (full details)

**Start with the working demo, then tackle the boxy challenge!** ðŸš€
